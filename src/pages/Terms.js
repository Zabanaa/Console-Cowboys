                        'as is' basis. ConsoleCowboys makes no warranties, expressed or
                        implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties
                        including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions
                        of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or

                        of rights.
                    </li>

                    <li>Further, ConsoleCowboys does not warrant or make any

                    liability for consequential or incidental damages,
                    these limitations may not apply to you.
